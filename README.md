# [Unit Converter](https://unit-converter-pwa.vercel.app/)

This is a unit conversion PWA project with offline functionality. 

I got the idea from [here](https://roadmap.sh/projects/unit-converter)

## Tools used
- Vercel for deployment
- Vite for building
  - Vite PWA plugin for adding PWA functionality
  - Vite PWA plugin asset generation cli for generating icons
- React using typescript
- Bun for package management
- [convert npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/convert/v/1.7.1?activeTab=dependencies) for conversion
- tailwindcss for styling
